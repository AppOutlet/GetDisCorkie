# **Privacy Policy for DisCorkie**

**Last Updated: June 26, 2024**  
This Privacy Policy explains how AppOutlet ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile and desktop application, DisCorkie (the "App").  
We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data in an open and transparent manner.

### **1\. Information We Collect**

We limit our data collection to what is essential for the App to function and to improve your experience.

* **Account Information:** When you create an account, we collect your email address. We use Supabase for authentication, which securely manages your login credentials and assigns a Unique User Identifier (UUID) to your account.  
* **Discourse Authentication Token:** To interact with your Discourse forums, the App requires an authentication token. This token is stored securely and exclusively on your local device and is deleted when you sign out. We never have access to this token.  
* **Subscription Data:** If you purchase a subscription, we collect necessary information to manage your subscription status. This is handled through the respective app stores (Apple App Store, Google Play Store) and our backend service, Supabase.  
* **Analytics Data (Umami):** We use Umami for analytics to understand how users interact with our App. Umami is a privacy-focused analytics tool that does **not** use cookies and anonymizes all collected data. It does not track you across sites and does not collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII). This helps us improve our service without compromising your privacy.  
* **Crash Reports & Diagnostics (Sentry):** To identify and fix bugs, crashes, and performance issues, we use Sentry. When the App crashes, Sentry may collect diagnostic information, which can include device model, operating system version, and the state of the app at the time of the crash. This data is used solely for improving the stability and performance of the App. We configure Sentry to avoid collecting personally identifiable information.

### **2\. How We Use Your Information**

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

* **To Provide and Maintain the Service:** To manage your account, authenticate you, and allow you to interact with your Discourse forums.  
* **To Manage Subscriptions:** To sync your subscription status across your devices.  
* **To Improve the App:** To understand usage patterns, diagnose problems, and make the App better, more stable, and more useful.  
* **To Communicate With You:** To respond to your support requests or inquiries.

### **3\. How We Share Your Information**

We do not sell your personal data. We only share information with third-party services that are essential for the App's operation:

* **Supabase:** Used for user authentication and database management.  
* **Sentry:** Used for crash reporting and performance monitoring.  
* **App Stores:** For processing and managing subscriptions.

We ensure that these third-party services uphold strict data protection and privacy standards.

### **4\. Data Storage and Security**

Your Discourse Authentication Token is stored only on your device. Other information, like your email and UUID, is stored securely within Supabase. We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction.

### **5\. Your Rights**

You have the right to access, correct, or request the deletion of your personal data. You can manage some of this information directly within the App. For any other requests, please contact us at the email address below.

### **6\. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you through the App or by other means, providing you an opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy will indicate when it was last revised.
